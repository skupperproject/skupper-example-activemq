title: Accessing an ActiveMQ message broker using Skupper
subtitle: Use public cloud resources to process data from a private message broker
github_actions_url: https://github.com/skupperproject/skupper-example-activemq/actions/workflows/main.yaml
overview: |
  This example is a simple messaging application that shows how you
  can use Skupper to access an ActiveMQ broker at a remote site
  without exposing it to the public internet.

  It contains two services:

  * An ActiveMQ broker running in a private data center.  The broker
    has a queue named "notifications".

  * An AMQP client running in the public cloud.  It sends 10 messages
    to "notifications" and then receives them back.

  For the broker, this example uses the [Apache ActiveMQ
  Artemis][artemis] image from [ArtemisCloud.io][artemiscloud].  The
  client is a simple [Quarkus][quarkus] application.

  The example uses two Kubernetes namespaces, "private" and "public",
  to represent the private data center and public cloud.

  [artemis]: https://activemq.apache.org/components/artemis/
  [artemiscloud]: https://artemiscloud.io/
  [quarkus]: https://quarkus.io/

  - title: Deploy the message broker
    preamble: |
      In the private namespace, use the `kubectl apply` command to
      install the broker.
    commands:
      private:
        - run: kubectl apply -f broker
          output: deployment.apps/broker created
  - title: Expose the message broker
    preamble: |
      In the private namespace, use `skupper expose` to expose the
      broker on the Skupper network.

      Then, in the public namespace, use `kubectl get service/broker`
      to check that the service appears after a moment.
    commands:
      private:
        - await: deployment/broker
        - run: skupper expose deployment/broker --port 5672
          output: deployment broker exposed as broker
      public:
        - run: kubectl get service/broker
          output: |
            NAME     TYPE        CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)    AGE
            broker   ClusterIP   10.100.58.95   <none>        5672/TCP   2s
  - title: Run the client
    preamble: |
      In the public namespace, use `kubectl run` to run the client.
    commands:
      public:
        - await: service/broker
        - run: kubectl run client --attach --rm --restart Never --image quay.io/skupper/activemq-example-client --env SERVER=broker
